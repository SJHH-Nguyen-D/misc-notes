# A Guide To Puchasing a Monitor

## Panel Types
* IPS - best bang for your buck if you want to do an all purpose gaming and working monitor. High refresh rate if you want to really get into gaming. has better response times, lower lag and less motion blur than VA. has good color acuity.
* VA - best bang for your buck if you want to do an all purpose gaming and working monitor. Maybe worse refresh rates than IPS
* TN - cheapest, and maybe not the best bang for your buck if you want to transition to something like gaming. TN has lowest possible response times and refresh rates.
* OLED - v expensive. good coloring and everything. rare

## Refresh Rates
Definition: how many times the screen is refreshed on the monitor every second. The higher the number, the smoother the on-screen motion looks. Most refresh rates are monitored in Hz, and most refresh at 60Hz or 60 times per second. This is fine but if you are a gamer, then 100Hz, or 144Hz or even 240Hz gives a much smoother and much faster gaming experience. Higher refresh rates also equates to higher costs, but you'll only see the benefits of high refresh rates if you PC has enough power to render all those frames every second. This is particularly important if you are using it for gaming. If you are using it for gaming, you probably already spent the money on a good graphics card. If you are using a fairly average PC, then you won't be able to fully take advantage of high refresh rates unless you are willing to drop your graphics settings. 

## Adaptive Sync 
For the smoothest possible gaming experience, try to get a monitor that supports variable refresh rates with adaptive rates, because this will eliminate something known as screen tearing - This is particularly noticeable at lower frames below 60 FPS. Adaptive sync can synchronize its refresh rate to the exact number of frames that is being outputted from your graphics card to produce a smoother motion. It avoids the previous work arounds of VSYNC, which would have resulted input lag and stuttering. 

There are two main types of Adaptive Sync:
* G-Sync: cost several hundred dollars more, because they have a custom controller chip built-in for that variable refresh rate. It comes in several flavors: G-Sync Ultimate(adds extra HDR and extra grindness?), G-Sync, G-Sync Compatible

* Free Sync 1 and 2: don't have a built-in chip so you can use any compatible AMD or NVIDIA graphics card. 

* Visa's Adaptive Sync Standard

# Response Times and Input Lag
### Response Time
Definition: How quickly a pixel can change what it is displaying. This is measured in milleseconds. A high response time (bad) can result in somethiing known as ghosting - the trail of images that you see from fast moving objects that really gets you kind of queezy. TN panels offer the fastest response times - offering response times as fast as 1 ms and are ideal for competitive gaming that is fast paced. 

IPS panels offer high response times, which equates to longer response times such as 5 ms but that is fine for most people and you probably wouldn't noticed the difference. 

Some premium VA panels can have fast response times but generally these are the slowest and thusly the most likely to suffer from motion blurring.

### Input Lag
Input lag isn't usually advertised by the manufacturer but it is worth looking into if you are a gamer. It is the time between when the graphics card outputs a signal and when it is actually displayed on the monitor. Example: the time between clicking on the mouse button and the gun firing on the game. So, again, it is like response times -> the less of it that you have, the better your experience will be. 11 ms for summed response times and input lag is ideal. Anything under 15/50 milleseconds combined is pretty reasonable too.

## HDR (High Dynamic Range)
The higher the maximum brightness of a monitor, the better. 
DisplayHDR Standard - 400 nits of brightness 
HDR 600 nits
HDR 1000 nits

## Color Acuity
Color Acuity is measured against a range of color gamuts. 

Color Gamuts:
* SRGB
* Adobe RGB 
* DCIP3

The closer the monitor is to matching 100% of a particular color gamut, the more color acuite it is. What can influence that is the color depth:
* 6 bit = 262, 144 colors
* 8 bit = 16.78 million colors
* 10 bit = 1 billion colors

## Connections
The vast majority of modern monitors will use HDMI 2.0, display port 1.2 or 1.4, USB-C as their main connector. Many will have HDMI and display port connections, but more expensive and newer models offer USB-C. You will need to check your graphics card or laptop ports to see which connection type to use. If you are outputting from your graphics card, I would usually recommending using a miniDisplay port 1.2 (mDP), as this will offer better refresh rates, 4K at 60Hz. DisplayPort 1.4 supports up to 8k. You do have to also consider HDMI 2.1 which is coming soon and is going to offer more bandwidth, higher resolution, high frame rates, but right now that is very rare. USB-C ports that is available for newer graphics cards and laptops. Some USB-C ports are ThunderBolt 3 enabled, which offers more bandwidth, which means you can output to multiple high resolution displays.

## Verdict
Choose a Free Sync 2 monitor as it will be cheaper; works well with AMD graphics cards. Choose something that is 24-27" with full HD, 1080p. Something with 60-100Hz for the refresh rate, with an IPS panel type (TN if you value lower response times). Low response times, and low input lag. 11 ms for summed response times and input lag is ideal. Anything under 15/50 milleseconds is reasonable. 8-bit color depth. Average User: {SRGB: > 90%, Adobe RGB: > 70%}, {SRGB: 100%, Adobe RGB: 85%}, 4ms G2G, 3000:1 con, 250 nits. 

If you want a wider monitor instead of getting two of them, then consider a 29-34 inch ultrawide
